# Todo List

This is a simple todo list application for Android. It is written in Java and with a modern MVVM architecture using the repository pattern and with several of the Android architecture components, such as:

- Navigation component
- ViewModel
- Room
- LiveData
- Data Binding

#### The app has the following features:

- Adding and editing tasks
- Setting a priority level for each task (low, medium, high)
- Adding notifications to tasks 
- Updating task notifications, or remove notifications with undo
- Completing and uncompleting tasks
- Delete individual, all completed, or all tasks
- Undo task deletion
- Dark mode, which can also be toggled from within the app
- Supports English and Norwegian languages

#### Potential improvements:

- Ability to search todo items
- Notification reminders that will be triggered by location(geofencing)
- (Adaptive) launcher icons

I have also made an iOS version: [iOS Todo List](https://github.com/fredrik9000/TodoList_iOS)
